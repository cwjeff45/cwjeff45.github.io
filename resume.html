            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring software developer, I have studied various subjects and languages over the years. I am currently 
                working as network / IT technician for a local company that has really opened my eyes to all 
                of the possibilities and avenues that IT has to offer. I love creating Python scripts for 
                daily automation and for simple games and mess around with Arduino projects when an idea comes to mind. I am most confident
                using Python, but have recently been studying networking, C, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS, and SQL. This webpage is my first attempt
                at utilizing everything I have spent so long researching to try and create something personal, yet professional.
