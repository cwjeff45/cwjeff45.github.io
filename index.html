                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently 27 years old and am Texas born and raised. I come from a family of pilots and love flying and aviation in general, but find 
                    programming and development so much more fun as I love a challenge and being able to use out-of-the-box thinking. I have an amazing wife and 
                    two beautiful kids, and we like to spend our free time watching anime, playing outside, or playing video games. </p>

                    <p>Personally, I am still very new to IT and tech in general and have been working hard for years to get my foot in the door and be able 
                    to contribute to a team to create amazing things! I am aspiring to be a software engineer and am currently studying various languages
                    and pushing myself to create things that I never would have imagined I could do 6 months ago.</p>
                    <p>Have a look around. Check out a few of my projects and then visit my Linkedin and Github to leave any feedback. Thank you for 
                        visiting my very first webpage!
